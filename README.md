# Employee Database Management System

This project is a simple database management system for managing employee information, including departments, employees, salaries, and job titles. It includes a SQL schema for database creation and several SQL queries for data retrieval and analysis.

## Getting Started

To get started with this project, follow these steps:

### Prerequisites

- SQL Server: Make sure you have SQL Server installed on your machine. You can download SQL Server Express Edition from the official Microsoft website [here](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/sql-server/sql-server-downloads).
- Visual Studio Code: Install Visual Studio Code, a lightweight and powerful code editor, from the official website [here](https://code.visualstudio.com/).
- SQL Server Extension for VS Code: Install the SQL Server extension for Visual Studio Code by Microsoft, which provides SQL language support and enables connection to SQL Server databases.

### Installation

1. Clone the repository to your local machine using Git:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/employee-database.git
   ```

2. Open the project directory in Visual Studio Code.

3. Install SQL Server Express Edition and SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS) if you haven't already. Use SSMS to create a new database and execute the schema.sql file to create the necessary tables.

4. Execute the queries in the queries.sql file to interact with the database and retrieve employee information.

## Usage

- `schema.sql`: Contains SQL statements to create tables for departments, employees, salaries, and job titles.
- `queries.sql`: Contains SQL queries to retrieve employee details, calculate average salaries per department, find employees with the highest and lowest salaries, and identify any anomalies in the data.
